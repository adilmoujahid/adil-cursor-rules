# Jupyter Notebook Standards

## Notebook Organization
- Store all notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder
- Use descriptive filenames with dates if relevant (e.g., `2024-01-15_data_analysis.ipynb`)
- Include a title and description in the first markdown cell
- Add a table of contents for longer notebooks

## Code Structure
- Import all required libraries in the first code cell
- Use one cell per logical operation or analysis step
- Add markdown cells to explain the purpose of each section
- Keep cells focused and avoid overly long code blocks

## Best Practices
- Clear all outputs before committing to version control
- Use meaningful variable names that describe the data
- Add comments to explain complex operations
- Include data source information and assumptions
- End with a summary or conclusion section

## Template Structure
```
# Notebook Title
Brief description of what this notebook does

## Table of Contents
1. Data Loading
2. Data Exploration
3. Analysis
4. Results
5. Conclusions

## 1. Data Loading
[Code cell with imports and data loading]

## 2. Data Exploration
[Code cells with exploration and markdown explanations]

... and so on
```

## Data Science Specific
- Always check for missing values and data types
- Include data validation steps
- Document any data transformations
- Save important intermediate results
- Include visualizations with proper titles and labels
